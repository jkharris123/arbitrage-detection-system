# Arbitrage Bot Project Status Report
## August 6, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the current state of the Kalshi-Polymarket arbitrage detection system, focusing on data collection, matching algorithms, and code maintenance practices established during development.

---

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a Python-based arbitrage detection and trading system that continuously monitors price differences between Polymarket and Kalshi prediction markets to identify risk-free profit opportunities.

**Target**: $1,000 daily profit through automated arbitrage detection and execution.

**Key Requirements**:
- Risk-free arbitrage only (guaranteed profit)
- Automated detection with Discord alerts
- Focus on liquid, near-term markets
- Clean, maintainable codebase

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Kalshi Integration** (FULLY OPERATIONAL)
   - API authentication with RSA keys
   - Market data collection functioning perfectly
   - Successfully fetching 300+ active contracts
   - Proper fee calculation implemented
   - Filtering by liquidity (≥$500) and expiry (≤30 days)

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Main orchestration via `fully_automated_enhanced.py`
   - Data collectors in `src/data_collectors/`
   - Matching logic in `src/matchers/`
   - Discord integration configured

3. **Data Collection Pipeline**
   - `collect_all_markets.py` successfully fetches from both platforms
   - Saves data as CSV and JSON for analysis
   - Proper error handling and logging

### ⚠️ Needs Verification

1. **Polymarket Integration**
   - API is returning data (1,700+ markets found)
   - However, CLOB (order book) API returning empty results
   - Fallback to gamma API working
   - Need to verify pricing data accuracy
   - Collection works but matching needs testing

2. **GPT-4 Matching System**
   - OpenAI API key configured
   - Matcher runs but needs result verification
   - Using GPT-4.1-mini for cost efficiency
   - Confidence thresholds need tuning

### 📊 Latest Collection Results

**With proper filters (≥$500 liquidity, ≤30 days expiry)**:
- Kalshi: 320 contracts
- Polymarket: 1,705 markets
- Total potential matches to evaluate: ~545,000 comparisons

## Code Cleanliness Principles

### Established Guidelines

1. **Single Purpose Files**
   - Each file should have one clear responsibility
   - No mixed concerns or kitchen-sink scripts

2. **Directory Organization**
   ```
   arbitrage_bot/
   ├── src/              # Core source code
   │   ├── data_collectors/   # API clients
   │   ├── detectors/         # Arbitrage detection
   │   └── matchers/          # Contract matching
   ├── scripts/          # Utility scripts
   │   └── diagnostics/       # Testing/debugging
   ├── data/             # Runtime data
   ├── config/           # Configuration
   └── tests/            # Test files
   ```

3. **File Management**
   - Test scripts go in `tests/` or `scripts/diagnostics/`
   - Remove files immediately after use if temporary
   - Use `.trash/` directory for files pending deletion
   - No test/debug files in root directory

4. **Naming Conventions**
   - Descriptive, purpose-driven names
   - No numbered versions (v1, v2, final, final_final)
   - Use git for version control, not filenames

## Critical Issues to Resolve

### 1. Polymarket Data Quality
```python
# Current issue: CLOB API returns empty
# Test needed:
async with EnhancedPolymarketClient() as client:
    clob_markets = await client._get_clob_markets()
    print(f"CLOB markets: {len(clob_markets)}")  # Returns 0
    
    # But gamma API works:
    markets = await client.get_markets_by_criteria(min_volume_usd=500)
    print(f"Gamma markets: {len(markets)}")  # Returns 1700+
```

### 2. Verify Pricing Data
- Polymarket markets show prices but need to verify accuracy
- Some prices may be estimates rather than real market data
- Need to test actual order execution prices

### 3. Matching Algorithm Validation
- GPT-4 matcher runs but outputs need review
- Check `manual_matches.csv` for results
- Manually verify a sample of matches for accuracy

---

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Polymarket Verification (PRIORITY)
```bash
# Test 1: Verify CLOB connectivity
cd /Users/kaseharris/arbitrage_bot
source arbitrage_env/bin/activate
python scripts/diagnostics/debug_polymarket_api.py

# Test 2: Check pricing accuracy
python scripts/diagnostics/test_polymarket_client.py

# Test 3: Manual spot check
# Compare displayed prices on polymarket.com with API results
```

### 2. Matching Algorithm Testing
```bash
# Run matcher and examine results
python src/matchers/openai_enhanced_matcher.py

# Check output
cat manual_matches.csv | head -20

# Verify matches make sense
# Look for obviously wrong matches (different events)
# Check confidence scores distribution
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify Polymarket returns real pricing data
- [ ] Confirm GPT matching identifies true equivalent events
- [ ] Test with smaller data subset first
- [ ] Validate arbitrage calculations include all fees
- [ ] Ensure execution prices account for slippage
- [ ] Test Discord alerts work correctly

### 4. Code Cleanup Tasks
```bash
# Remove any test files in root
mv test_*.py .trash/

# Check for duplicate functionality
find . -name "*.py" -type f -exec grep -l "similar_function" {} \;

# Remove old versions
rm kalshi_*_v2.py kalshi_*_final.py
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Polymarket CLOB API Empty
**Symptom**: CLOB API returns 0 markets but gamma API returns 1700+  
**Impact**: May not have real-time order book data  
**Solution**: Investigate CLOB endpoints, check for API changes, use gamma as fallback

### Issue 2: GPT Matching Confidence
**Symptom**: Unclear how accurate matches are  
**Impact**: May identify false arbitrage opportunities  
**Solution**: Manual verification of sample matches, adjust confidence thresholds

### Issue 3: File Clutter
**Symptom**: Root directory gets cluttered with test files  
**Impact**: Harder to maintain and navigate codebase  
**Solution**: Strict file organization, immediate cleanup after testing
