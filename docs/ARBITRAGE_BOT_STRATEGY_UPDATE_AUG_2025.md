# Arbitrage Bot Strategy Update - August 2025

## Executive Summary
This document outlines critical updates to the arbitrage bot's operational strategy, focusing on full automation and improved efficiency through contract caching and streamlined Discord alerts.

---

## 1. Discord Alert Strategy Change

### Previous Approach:
- Alert for every arbitrage opportunity
- Require manual approval for trade execution
- PM reviews and clicks "Accept/Decline" for each trade

### NEW Approach (Effective Immediately):
- **FULLY AUTOMATED EXECUTION** for verified contract matches
- Discord alerts ONLY for:
  1. **New contract pairs** that need match verification
  2. **System errors** requiring intervention
  3. **Daily profit summaries**

### New Alert Flow:
```
1. New contract pair detected
   └─> Discord alert: "New potential match: [Kalshi Contract] ↔ [Polymarket Contract]"
   └─> PM responds: "MATCH" or "NO MATCH"
   └─> If MATCH → Add to verified_matches.csv
   
2. Arbitrage opportunity on verified match
   └─> NO ALERT - Execute automatically
   └─> Log execution in daily summary

3. Daily summary (6 PM EST)
   └─> "Today: 12 trades executed, $847 profit, 0 errors"
```

## 2. Contract Match Caching System

### Problem Solved:
- Avoid re-matching the same contracts every 15 minutes
- Reduce API calls and processing time
- Eliminate redundant verification requests

### Implementation:
- **verified_matches.csv**: Stores PM-confirmed matches
- **match_cache.json**: Stores all potential matches with metadata
- **rejection_cache.csv**: Stores rejected matches to avoid re-checking

### Cache Structure:
```csv
# verified_matches.csv
kalshi_ticker,poly_condition_id,verified_by,verified_at,active
KXCPI-25JUL-T2.8,0x34e28b723891da,PM,2025-08-05T20:15:00,true

# rejection_cache.csv
kalshi_ticker,poly_condition_id,rejected_by,rejected_at,reason
KXBTC-25AUG-T110000,0x9e34768511be77,PM,2025-08-05T20:16:00,different_events
```

## 3. Execution Logic Update

### Old Logic:
```
IF arbitrage_opportunity_exists:
    send_discord_alert()
    wait_for_approval()
    IF approved:
        execute_trade()
```

### NEW Logic:
```
IF arbitrage_opportunity_exists:
    IF contracts_in_verified_matches:
        execute_trade_immediately()
        log_to_daily_summary()
    ELSE:
        IF not_in_rejection_cache:
            send_verification_alert()
            cache_response()
```

## 4. Expected Benefits

### Time Savings:
- **-95% reduction** in Discord alerts
- **-99% reduction** in manual interventions
- **100% faster** execution on known matches

### Profit Impact:
- **Capture more opportunities** due to faster execution
- **Reduce slippage** from delayed approvals
- **24/7 operation** without PM availability constraints

### Risk Management:
- Only execute on **PM-verified matches**
- Maintain all existing risk limits
- Emergency stop still available via Discord

- **Phase 2** (Today): Implement verified_matches.csv system
- **Phase 3** (Today): Update execution logic for full automation
- **Phase 4** (Tomorrow): Deploy and monitor

## 6. Key Files to Update

1. **fully_automated_enhanced.py**: Main execution logic
2. **discord_integration.py**: Alert system modifications
3. **claude_matched_detector.py**: Use verified matches cache
4. **verified_matches.csv**: New file for confirmed matches
5. **rejection_cache.csv**: New file for rejected matches
