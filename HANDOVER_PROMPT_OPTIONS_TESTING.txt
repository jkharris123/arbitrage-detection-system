HANDOVER PROMPT FOR CROSS-ASSET ARBITRAGE TESTING
=================================================

## CONTEXT
I'm the PM working on a Python arbitrage bot that currently does pure prediction market arbitrage (Kalshi ↔ Polymarket). I manually discovered profitable arbitrage opportunities between Kalshi S&P prediction markets and SPY options (5-10% typical edge, much higher than the 0.01% in traditional arbitrage). Example: Kalshi NO on S&P 6350+ at 64% vs SPY 634/635 call spread at ~45% probability = 19% edge.

## WHAT WAS JUST BUILT
1. **IBKR Options Client** (`/Users/kaseharris/arbitrage_bot/src/data_collectors/ibkr_options_client.py`)
   - Connects to IBKR TWS for real-time SPY options data
   - Fetches option chains with Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega, IV)
   - Calculates implied probabilities from options prices
   - Finds SPY spreads equivalent to Kalshi S&P levels (S&P/10 = SPY)
   - Calculates arbitrage opportunities with exact commission costs
   - Tracks monthly volume for commission tier optimization

2. **Test Script** (`/Users/kaseharris/arbitrage_bot/test_ibkr_options.py`)
   - Tests all functionality needed for cross-asset arbitrage
   - Simulates scenarios similar to my successful manual trade
   - Shows cost breakdowns and profitability analysis

## CURRENT STATUS
- IBKR options client is complete and ready for testing
- Uses existing bot infrastructure (60% code reuse)
- Integrates with current Kalshi client and execution framework
- Commission structure implemented (real costs: $2-3 per spread)

## TO TEST THE SYSTEM
1. Make sure IBKR TWS is running with API enabled:
   - File → Global Configuration → API → Settings
   - Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients
   - Socket port: 7496 (live) or 7497 (paper)
   - Add trusted IP: 127.0.0.1

2. Activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kaseharris/arbitrage_bot
   conda activate arbitrage_env
   ```

3. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   python test_ibkr_options.py
   ```

## EXPECTED TEST RESULTS
The test will:
- Connect to TWS and get current SPY price
- Fetch SPY option chains for next expiry (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Find option spreads matching Kalshi S&P levels
- Calculate arbitrage for 4 scenarios (including one like my 19% edge trade)
- Show which scenarios are profitable after all costs
- Display commission tier information

## KEY STRATEGY POINTS
- Target: 0DTE (same-day) SPY options for settlement alignment
- Kalshi settles at 4PM ET on S&P close
- SPY options trade until 4:15 PM ET
- Must close options by 3:50 PM to avoid assignment risk
- Need ~5% edge minimum to cover all costs (Kalshi fees + IBKR commissions)

## NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING
1. Verify option data quality and Greeks accuracy
2. Test with live Kalshi data for real arbitrage detection
3. Implement automated position closing before 3:50 PM
4. Add cross-asset matching logic to main detector
5. Test paper trading before going live

## KEY FILES REFERENCE
- `/docs/Cross_Asset_Arbitrage_Implementation_Analysis.md` - Full strategy documentation
- `/src/data_collectors/ibkr_options_client.py` - New options client
- `/src/data_collectors/kalshi_client.py` - Existing Kalshi client (works perfectly)
- `/src/detectors/detector.py` - Main arbitrage detector (needs cross-asset enhancement)

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- Using IBKR Pro with tiered commissions (currently $0.65/contract, drops to $0.15 at 100k+/month)
- Real commission costs are $2-3 per spread including all fees
- Strategy requires $25-50k capital for meaningful profits
- Expected profit: $500-1,500/day with proper execution

Please test the IBKR options functionality and let me know the results. The test script should show whether we're successfully getting option data and finding profitable arbitrage opportunities.
